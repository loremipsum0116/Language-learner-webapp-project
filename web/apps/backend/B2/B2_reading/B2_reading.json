It was the unique wildlife of these islands that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. He observed that finches and tortoises on different islands had developed distinct traits that were adapted to their specific environments. For example, finches had different beak shapes depending on their primary food source on a particular island.

They were also skilled traders and craftsmen. Their society had a sophisticated legal code, and they produced a rich body of literature, most notably the sagas.

This process is an alternative to traditional mining methods like smelting, which can be energy-intensive and produce harmful pollutants. In biomining, bacteria are used to oxidize minerals, which helps to dissolve the metals and allows them to be collected. This technique is particularly useful for low-grade ores, from which it would be uneconomical to extract metals using conventional methods.

The more often we are exposed to a stimulus, whether it's a song, a face, or a word, the more we tend to like it. This familiarity principle operates on a subconscious level. It is a powerful tool in advertising, where repeated exposure to a brand name or logo can build a positive association in consumers' minds, even without them consciously processing the ads.

For centuries, Troy was considered by most scholars to be a mythical city, existing only in the epic poems of Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Schliemann, a English businessman and a passionate believer in the historical reality of Homer's tales, used the poems as a guide to locate the site in modern-day Turkey.
