Passage: My partner and I decided to paint our kitchen ourselves to save money. We thought it would be an easy weekend job. We were wrong. Preparing the walls took much longer than we expected, and we accidentally spilled some paint on the floor. It was a stressful experience, and the final result is not perfect, but we feel proud that we did it ourselves. Next time, however, we might hire a professional.

Passage: I've been going to a yoga class for about six months. It's not just about physical exercise; it's also about calming the mind. The breathing exercises help me to feel less stressed. Physically, I feel much more flexible and my back pain has improved. It's a great way to take care of both my body and mind.

Passage: I was in a cafe yesterday and I saw a man who looked exactly like a famous actor. I was too shy to go and talk to him, so I discreetly took a photo to show my friends. Later, I looked at the actor's social media and saw that he was in a different country that day. It was just someone who looked very similar. I felt a bit silly, but it was a funny story to tell my friends.

Passage: Last summer, my friends and I rented a small cabin in the mountains for a week. We spent our days hiking and exploring the beautiful scenery. In the evenings, we cooked together and played board games. There was no Wi-Fi or phone signal, which was strange at first, but it was great to disconnect and just enjoy each other's company. It was one of the most relaxing holidays I've ever had.

Passage: I was supposed to fly to Berlin for a business meeting tomorrow. However, this morning my boss called me to say the meeting has been postponed for two weeks. I had already packed my suitcase and arranged for a taxi to the airport. It's a bit inconvenient to change all my plans, but on the bright side, it gives me more time to prepare for the meeting.

Passage: My first job was working in a bookshop during the summer holidays when I was 17. I was responsible for putting books on the shelves and helping customers. I was very nervous at first, but my manager was very kind and patient. I learned a lot about responsibility and how to talk to different kinds of people. It wasn't well-paid, but it was a valuable experience.

Passage: Our family went to the science museum last weekend. It was much more fun than I expected. There were lots of interactive exhibits where you could press buttons and conduct small experiments. My kids particularly enjoyed the section about space, with a model of the solar system. It was a great way to learn about science in a hands-on way, for both children and adults.

Passage: I'm taking an online course in graphic design. The main advantage is the flexibility; I can study whenever I have free time. However, I sometimes miss the experience of a real classroom. It's harder to ask the teacher a quick question, and I don't have the chance to discuss ideas with other students. It requires a lot of self-discipline to stay on track.

Passage: I still remember my high school history teacher, Mr. Evans. He didn't just make us memorize dates and names. He told history like a series of fascinating stories, which made the subject come alive. He encouraged us to ask questions and think critically about the past. He had a real passion for his subject, and that passion was infectious. He is the reason I decided to study history at university.

Passage: My best friend moved to Australia two years ago. It's been hard being so far apart. We try to have a video call every week, but the time difference makes it difficult to schedule. We send each other messages and photos, but it's not the same as meeting for a coffee and a chat. Despite the distance, we are still very close, but it requires effort from both of us.

Passage: On my last holiday, the airline lost my luggage. I arrived in Rome, but my suitcase didn't. I had to spend the first two days of my trip wearing the same clothes and buying essential things like a toothbrush. The airline staff were helpful, and they finally delivered my suitcase to my hotel on the third day. It was a stressful start to the holiday, but I didn't let it ruin my trip.

Passage: I've recently discovered the joy of birdwatching. I bought a pair of binoculars and a guidebook. I just sit in my local park and try to identify the different birds I see. It's a very calm and peaceful hobby. It has taught me to be more patient and observant. I get genuinely excited when I spot a bird that I haven't seen before.

Passage: I was having a really bad day yesterday. I missed my bus, I was late for work, and I had a headache. In the afternoon, I went to a coffee shop. When I went to pay, the person in front of me in the queue had already paid for my coffee. He just smiled and said, 'Pass it on.' This small act of kindness from a stranger completely changed my mood. It was a lovely reminder that there is a lot of good in the world.

Passage: I recently found an old certificate from a swimming competition I won when I was ten. I remember being so proud of that achievement. I had practiced for months, getting up early before school to go to the pool. It wasn't just about winning; it was about setting a goal and working hard to achieve it. Looking at the certificate reminded me that with dedication, I can achieve things that seem difficult at first.
