a blessing in disguise
a dime a dozen
a far cry from
a flash in the pan
a stone's throw
a taste of your own medicine
a tough pill to swallow
a whole new ballgame
add fuel to the fire
against the clock
ahead of the curve
all ears
all in your head
all set
all thumbs
along for the ride
an uphill battle
apple of my eye
at the end of the day
back to square one
back to the drawing board
backseat driver
bad blood
bail out
ballpark figure
barking up the wrong tree
beat around the bush
beat me to it
behind closed doors
behind the eight ball
bend over backwards
bite off more than you can chew
bite the bullet
bite the dust
blaze a trail
blow off steam
blow the whistle
boil down to
break a sweat
break even
break new ground
break the ice
bring down the house
bring home the bacon
brush up on
burn bridges
burn the candle at both ends
burn the midnight oil
by the book
by the skin of your teeth
call it a day
call the shots
calm before the storm
carry weight
caught off guard
change of heart
chew the fat
chip on your shoulder
cold feet
come clean
come full circle
come to grips with
come to light
come to terms with
cook the books
cool as a cucumber
cost an arm and a leg
crack down on
cross that bridge when you come to it
cry over spilled milk
cut corners
cut it close
cut to the chase
dark horse
dead in the water
devil's advocate
down to the wire
draw a blank
draw the line
drop the ball
ease up on
eat crow
eat humble pie
eat like a horse
elephant in the room
eye candy
face the music
fair and square
fall flat
fall into place
fall through
few and far between
fish out of water
fit the bill
fly off the handle
follow suit
foot the bill
for good measure
from the ground up
from the horse's mouth
full of hot air
game changer
get a grip
get a head start
get cold feet
get it off your chest
get on someone's nerves
get the ball rolling
get the hang of
get to the bottom of
get your act together
give it a shot
give the green light
go belly up
go off the rails
go out on a limb
go the extra mile
go with the flow
golden opportunity
grease the wheels
green light
grey area
hair of the dog
half-baked
hand in glove
hands are tied
hard nut to crack
have a blast
have skin in the game
head over heels
heads up
heart of the matter
hit it off
hit rock bottom
hit the books
hit the ground running
hit the hay
hit the nail on the head
hold your horses
hold your tongue
in a nutshell
in hot water
in over your head
in the black
in the dark
in the driver's seat
in the long run
in the pipeline
in the red
in the same boat
jack of all trades
jump on the bandwagon
jump the gun
keep a low profile
keep an eye on
keep at bay
keep your chin up
keep your cool
keep your fingers crossed
kill two birds with one stone
knock on wood
know the ropes
last straw
lay it on thick
lead by example
learn the ropes
leave no stone unturned
let sleeping dogs lie
let the cat out of the bag
light at the end of the tunnel
lion's share
live and learn
lose your touch
make a long story short
make ends meet
make waves
miss the boat
muddy the waters
neck and neck
no-brainer
off the cuff
off the hook
off the record
on a roll
on cloud nine
on pins and needles
on second thought
on the fence
on the same page
on thin ice
once in a blue moon
out of pocket
out of the blue
out of the woods
out of the question
out of your depth
paint the town red
pass the buck
penny for your thoughts
piece of cake
play it by ear
play second fiddle
point of no return
pull a rabbit out of a hat
pull punches
pull someone's leg
pull the plug
pull your weight
push the envelope
put all your eggs in one basket
put your foot down
put your money where your mouth is
raise the bar
read between the lines
red tape
rule of thumb
run out of steam
salt of the earth
save face
see eye to eye
set in stone
shoot the breeze
shoot yourself in the foot
silver lining
skeletons in the closet
sleep on it
spill the beans
split hairs
square the circle
start from scratch
state of the art
steal someone's thunder
stick to your guns
storm in a teacup
take a rain check
take it with a grain of salt
take the bull by the horns
take the cake
take the edge off
the ball is in your court
the big picture
the bottom line
the home stretch
the icing on the cake
the run of the mill
the tip of the iceberg
think on your feet
throw in the towel
throw someone under the bus
tie up loose ends
time flies
to add insult to injury
touch base
turn a blind eye
turn the tables
under the weather
up in the air
upper hand
water under the bridge
wear many hats
when pigs fly
wild goose chase
word of mouth
work like a charm
write off
zero in on
zip your lip
across the board
after the fact
against all odds
at face value
at the drop of a hat
back of the envelope
back to back
bang for the buck
bear the brunt
beat a dead horse
behind the scenes
between a rock and a hard place
big picture
bite your tongue
blow it out of proportion
bring to the table
brush it under the rug
by and large
call a spade a spade
call it quits
catch-22
change gears
close but no cigar
come out of left field
come rain or shine
cut some slack
devil is in the details
double down
down the line
drag your feet
draw a line in the sand
fill in the blanks
give me a break
hit the jackpot
keep your head above water
leave well enough alone
make a scene
make the cut
meet in the middle
move the goalposts
off the beaten path
on the back burner
on the ball
on the dot
on the fly
on the go
on the house
on the mend
on the nose
on the side
on the spot
on the verge
out and about
out of line
out of the loop
out of touch
over the moon
play hardball
play it safe
raise eyebrows
rain on your parade
rock the boat
rub salt in the wound
rule out
save the day
see the light
shoot for the stars
skate on thin ice
sleep tight
smell a rat
spell it out
spin your wheels
split the difference
stand your ground
step up your game
stick a fork in it
stretch the truth
sweep under the rug
take a back seat
take five
take it easy
talk turkey
think twice
throw cold water on
toe the line
turn the corner
up to speed
walk a fine line
walk the talk
wear your heart on your sleeve
with flying colors

be that as it may
before you know it

for what it's worth
if push comes to shove
in any case
in no time
in the first place
in the nick of time
in the works
it goes without saying
keep your eyes peeled
let bygones be bygones
make no mistake
no strings attached
off the top of my head
on and off
on the contrary
on the flip side
on your toes
sooner rather than later
that being said
to tell you the truth
for crying out loud
